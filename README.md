# StrainLib

StrainLib is essentially a small REST API web interface implemented with [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org)

It uses [The Strain API](http://strains.evanbusse.com/)

## At the moment requests seem to work only on my home desktop in Firefox(reasons unknown)
## TODO: scrape DB and make my own backend

###### Usage of named API initially sets certain usage limitations:
* Requests are few and search is possible only by one criteria (client-side filtration to be implemented)

Roadmap:
* Set pagination for search results
* Add client-side filtration for multiple criteria
* Add ability to compare entities
