# StrainLib

StrainLib is essentially a small REST API web interface implemented with [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org)

It uses [The Strain API](http://strains.evanbusse.com/)

## At the moment requests seem to work only on my home desktop in Firefox(reasons unknown)
## TODO: scrape DB and make my own backend

<!-- Currently allows searching strains by name, race, or an effect the strain has. Results can be seen singularly on a separate page

###### Usage of named API initially sets certain usage limitations:
* Currently impossible to use in Chrome due to issues with server certificate(please use Firefox)
* Requests are few and search is possible only by one criteria (client-side filtration to be implemented)

Roadmap:
* Set pagination for search results
* Add client-side filtration for multiple criteria(effect/set of effects, flavor/set of flavors, race)
* Possibly add ability to compare strains by effects/flavors -->
